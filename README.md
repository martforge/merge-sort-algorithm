# merge-sort-algorithm

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python merge_sort.py
   ```

### Example Input and Output

Input:
```python
numbers = [4, 10, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8, 5]
```

Output:
```
Unsorted array:
[4, 10, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8, 5]
Sorted array:
[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14]
```

## How It Works

1. Split the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the sorted halves back together.
